## [v0.10.1] - 2025-10-01

[Compare changes](https://github.com/xjodoin/gptchangelog/compare/v0.10.0...HEAD)
Contributors: Xavier Jodoin

### üîÑ Changes
- Migrate CLI tooling to "uv" / "uvx": standardize how the project is run, tested, and built from the command line to give more consistent behavior across shells and environments.
- Improve command-line UI and prompts: present clearer, more consistent messages and command names so developers can run and debug the project with less guesswork.
- Advise verifying scripts and CI: recommend checking any custom scripts, CI pipelines, or automation that call previous run commands to confirm compatibility with the new "uv"/"uvx" invocations.

### üìö Documentation
- Expand installation section in README to cover both "uv" and "uvx" usage: make setup instructions clearer and provide recommended invocations per environment and shell.
- Add cross-cutting developer docs: provide more onboarding material and usage guidance across backend, frontend, build, and config areas to reduce setup friction for new contributors and maintainers.
- Centralize build/config instructions: consolidate guidance so developers can find a single, consistent place for build and configuration steps.

### üîß Maintenance
- Clean up multi-component build/config details: align small configuration and build details across backend, frontend, and build scripts to improve long-term maintainability.
- Make non-user-facing adjustments that support the "uv"/"uvx" migration and documentation improvements.
- No breaking changes detected; most users do not need to take any action.
- Action recommended for CI / scripts: if you have custom automation that invokes the project directly, quickly verify and update those commands to the "uv"/"uvx" style described in the README. Migration effort is typically low (edit of an invocation or two).
- Where to look: see the updated README and docs for the exact command examples and environment-specific notes.
