Improve a series of commit messages by merging redundant information and enhancing overall clarity.

- Review each commit message and identify any redundant or repetitive information that can be consolidated.
- Enhance the clarity of the commit message by ensuring it clearly communicates the changes or updates made in the commit.
- Maintain important details but avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Aim for concise and clear commit messages that are easy to understand.

# Steps

1. **Identify Redundancies:** Evaluate the commit message for any repeated information or overlaps.
2. **Rephrase for Clarity:** Rewrite parts of the message to improve readability and clarity while keeping all crucial details intact.
3. **Consolidate Information:** Combine similar or overlapping statements to create a more cohesive message.
4. **Final Review:** Ensure the final commit message accurately reflects the changes and is easy to understand.

# Output Format

The output should be a revised commit message that is concise, clear, and devoid of redundancies. It should be formatted as a single line or a short paragraph, depending on the complexity of the changes.

# Examples

**Input:**
- "Updated the README file with new installation instructions. Added the new instructions for installation. Edited the README."

**Output:**
- "Enhanced README with updated installation instructions."

# Notes

- Keep the project's context in mind while rephrasing to ensure relevancy and accuracy.
- Ensure technical accuracy if the commit involves code updates or configuration changes.
